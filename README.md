Version: 1.0.x

> A new way to create master-details (parent -> children) relationships with Symphony's sections.

### SPECS ###

- Supports multiple sections for the same relationship.
- Offers developers the possibility to create xslt templates for the field's backend UI.
- Offers a modal UI in order to create/edit for the children.
- Compatible with Symphony associations.
- Supports multiple level (recursive) of associations.
- Aims to be compatible with *all* fields.

### REQUIREMENTS ###

- Symphony CMS version 2.5.1 and up (as of the day of the last release of this extension)

### INSTALLATION ###

- `git clone` / download and unpack the tarball file
- Put into the extension directory
- Enable/install just like any other extension

You can also install it using the [extension downloader](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/extension_downloader/).
Just search for `entry_relationship_field`.

For more information, see <http://getsymphony.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/>

### HOW TO USE ###

- Go to the section editor and add an Entry Relationship field.
- Give it a name.
- Select at least one section that will be permitted as children.
- Select also the fields you want to be available in the backend templates and data sources.
- [Create backend templates](#backend-templates) in the `workspace/er-templates` folder.
    - The name of the file must be `section-handle.xsl`
    - You need at least one template that matches `entry`
    - Protip: add `?debug` to backend url to see the available xml for each entry.
    - Protip: You can also override the default debug template with     
    `<xsl:template match="/data" mode="debug" priority="1"></xsl:template>`
    - Protip: You can create buttons yourself, using the [data-attribute api](#Data-attribute-API).
- (Optional) Select an xsl mode to be able to support multiple templates for the same section.
- (Optional) Select a maximum recursion level for nested fields.
- (Optional) Select a minimum and maximum number of elements for this field.

There is also a [screen cast available](https://www.screenr.com/pDDN)

### Backend templates ###

Here's what a basic backend template should look like.

```xslt
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="entry">
    <div>
        <h1>
            <xsl:value-of select="./*[1]" />
        </h1>
    </div>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

### Data-attribute API

In your backend template, you can create button that uses the same features as the default ones.
The only markup needed is a data-attribute on the button.    
The provided actions are:

- Edit entry `data-edit="{entry-id}"`
- Unlink entry `data-unlink="{entry-id}"`
- Link entry `data-link="{section-handle}"`
- Delete entry `data-delete="{entry-id}"`
- Create entry `data-create="{section-handle}"`
- Replace entry `data-replace="{entry-id}"`

Attribute value is always optional: It will revert to the closest data-attribute it can find in the DOM.

No validation is made to check if the feature has been activated in the field's setting, so use at your own risks.

### AKNOWLEDGMENTS ###

This field would not have been created if some other people did not released some really 
cool stuff. We would like to thanks everybody that contributed to those projects:

- [symphonycms/selectbox_link_field](https://github.com/symphonycms/selectbox_link_field)
- [hananils/subsectionmanager](https://github.com/hananils/subsectionmanager)
- [psychoticmeow/content_field](https://github.com/psychoticmeow/content_field)

We basically trashed things that were not necessary and re-implemented things that we liked
from those extensions.
